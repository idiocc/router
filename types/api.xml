    The `init` function will scan files in the passed `dir` folder and add routes found for each method to the router. The default `dir` is `src/routes` and the config should be passed to control how the middleware and aliases are set up for each method.
  </method>

  <method name="watchRoutes" async return="!Watcher">
    <arg type="!_idio.WatchConfig" name="config">The watch config returned by the `initRoutes` method.</arg>

    After the routes were initialised, it is possible to pass the value returned by the `initRoutes` method to the `watchRoutes` function to enable hot-route reload on the development environment. Every change to the module source code will trigger an update of the route including its aliases. *The middleware and aliases changes are not currently implemented.*
